<!-- 
    Block (vs) InLine Elements:
    --------------------------
    Block Elements
            - Takes up the full-width available [whole block], even if the content within it don’t require.
            - Starts from new line
            - It actually divides the entire page into blocks of content.
            - ex: h-tags, p-tags, div-tag etc..

    InLine Elements
            - Takes up only necessarly width [ necessary by the content within the tag ]
            - Don’t start from new line but from the end of the previous element
            - These are actually used to differentiate the specific part of the text
            - ex: anchor-tag, img-tag, span-tag etc..

    
    We can verify an element whether it is Block (or) inLine using
        - inspect
        - by actually writing 2 similar elements next by next

    NOTE:
    ---- 
    <body> tag is a Block level element
-->


<!-- 
    <div> (vs) <span>:
    -----------------
    DIV element <div>
        - `<div>` → Content Division Element
        - Div is a container used to hold other html elments (or) group elements together [ so that those elements can be easily styled ]
        - Div is a block-level Element
        - It has no effect on the content or layout, until styled in some way using CSS

    SPAN Element <span>
        - Span is same sa Div element except it is an InLine Container.
            - i.e., elements grouped together using `<span>` shows In-line behavior
        - Span is an InLine element.

    NOTE:
    ----
    These <div> or <span> elements should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate.

<!-- 
    <sub> & <sup> tags:
    ------------------
        - `<sub>` → used to describe the content as SubScript
        - `<sup>` → used to describe the content as SuperScript
-->


<!-- 
    Semantic Tags:
    -------------
    - In programming, **Semantics** refers to the *meaning* of a piece of code
    - Semantic tags → Tags that describes it’s meaning of the content [ to both browser & developer ]
    - i.e., upon looking into these tags names itself we can understand what are these tags used for.

    - Why Semantic Tags..?
        - These tags makes the code more meaningful & forms a structured layout
        - These are used to make the website SEO friendly
        - It is very useful for screen readers for accessibility

    Some Imp semantic tags:
    ----------------------
    - <header> tag  → represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links
    - <nav> tag     → defines a set of navigation links.
    - <main> tag    → specifies the main/dominant content of a document.
    - <footer> tag  → defines a footer for a document or section 
    - <section> tag → same as div tag but semantic
    - <aside> tag   → used to contain the related information to the document’s main content → usually sidebars (or) call-out boxes
    - <article> tag → specifies independent, self-contained content which make sense on its own
-->

<!-- 
    <figure> & <figcaption>:
    -----------------------
    - The `<figure>` tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
    - The `<figcaption>` tag defines a caption for a `<figure>` element
    - The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.
-->


<!-- 
    HTML Entities:
    -------------
    - HTML Entity is a piece of text [”string”] that starts with `&` and ends with `semicolon ;`
    - These are used to display reserved characters, invisible characters [spaces] & 
    special characters which are difficult to type with a standard keyboard [ like hearts symbol ].
    - ex: &amp; &lt; &gt; &quot; &nbsp; &hearts;

    In between & and ; it either goes name (or) #decimal_number
    → sometimes we will find Unicode numbers, which is then needs to be converted into decimal number& then add # infront of it.
    - ex: &#9733;
-->


<!-- 
    NOTE:
    ----
    wkt, HTML is NOT Case-Sensitive
        - Hence `<tags>` are also NOT Case-Sensitive
        - But `&Entities;` are "Case-Sensitive"
-->


<!-- 
    Emmets:
    ------
    - Emmet is a plugin for many popular text editors
    - This plugin provides us emmet abbriviations which are shorthand for code snippets to code faster

    Some of the shortforms are:
    - Child ( > ) :  nav>ul>li ⇒ `nav` contains `ul` , now ul becomes child of nav
    - sibling ( + ) :  nav+ul ⇒ `nav` comes along with `ul` , these 2 are at same level
    - multipication ( * ) :  ul>li*5 ⇒ inside `ul` we will get 5 `li` elements
-->


<!-- 
    HTML5:
    -----
    - HTML Standard → is a Document that tells browser how HTML should work
            - i.e Browser renders the HTML doc according to HTML standard
    - HTML5 not only contains HTML Standard but also some JS API’s for storage, multimedia Harware Access etc..
