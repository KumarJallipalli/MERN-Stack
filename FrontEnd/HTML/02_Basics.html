    ## What is HTML..?

        - HTML provides description[structure & format] of webpage
            - i.e., it tells the browser, what, where & how to display the content
            - Structure → Describes what & where the contents to be displayed
            - Format → Describes How the contents to be displayed.
        - HTML is Case-InSenstive language [⇒ Tags are also Case-InSensitive]
-->


<!-- 
    ## Browser:
- Purpose of browser [like chrome, edge..] is to read the HTML doc,render it & display it correctly.
- browser doesn't display the HTML tags, but it uses tags to determine what, where & how to display the content of webpage.
        - HTML Doc -> Rendered by Browser -> Displayed to User as Web-Page
-->

    ## What is MarkUp Language..?

        - ML uses markup tools like HTML tags to annotate/mark-up the text. i.e., why called Mark-Up language
            - Annotate -> It is to format/style the text so that, it will stand out from the remaining text.

        - Hence, HTML is Not just any Language but a "Mark-Up Language".

-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- 
    [Case-InSensitive] 
    → It tells the browser that it is a HTML V5 document. [So that browser will render according to V5 rules]
-->

<html lang="en">    <!-- → here "lang" attribute describes the language in which this document is written -->
<!-- 
    - <html> tag is the root tag.
    - Everything we want to write, we have to write inside <html> tag.
-->

<head>

        across from hindi, telugu & other lang alphabets and symbols etc… 
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <!-- 
        - viewport → screen/display visible to us that actually displays the content
        - width = device-width → show the width of viewport as the device’s width [like mobile, desktop accordingly]
        - initial-scale = 1.0 → It is the zoom ratio at the time of 1st load. set this zoom level to 1 [i.e., 100%, means no zoom] 
    -->
    <title>HTML BASICS - I</title>
    <!-- 
        - This describes the title of the webpage itself & is shown on the tab area along with favicon
				- Google searches the google queries based on the title tag inside the head tag. i.e., why title tag is V.Imp for SEO
    -->
</head>
