    ## H - tags
        - h-tag → HTML section heading tag.
        - Heading tags in HTML are used to "give a title or subtitle to a section" of the webpage.
        - It consists of total 6 levels of section headings
            - "<h1>" - "<h6>" with "<h1>" being the highest section level & "<h6>" being the lowest section.
            - As "h1" is an important part of SEO & used to give the Main Keyword to the whole content.
                - i.e., why Use "<h1>" tag only once in entire document & it is a good practice
        - Some of these h-tags are lesser in size compared to p-tag [p-tag === h4-tag without bold].
    -->
    <h1>This is Heading 1..</h1>
    <h2>This is Heading 2..</h2>
    <h3>This is Heading 3..</h3>
    <h4>This is Heading 4..</h4>
    <h5>This is Heading 5..</h5>
    <h6>This is Heading 6..</h6>

    <h7>This is Heading 7..</h7>
    <h8>This is Heading 8..</h8>
    This is Just a normal text
    written in multiple paras but treated as a single para
    <!-- 
    ### Why h-tags are only upto h6..?
        - As 5 levels are mostly sufficient for heading purpose of a document but 6 levels being the standard defined by SGML.
        - After h6, all the numbers will behave like a directly written normal text
    
    NOTE:
        - We can directly write text content without any html tags too
        - This text behaves like a <p> tag

    <!-- 
    ## P-tag:
        "<p>" paragraph tag is used to "display text content as paragraphs" on a web page.
                * <p> tag have same text size as "<h4> tag [without bold]"
                * <p> tags can also be used for line breaks.

    NOTE:
    ———-
        - HTML ignore all the extra spaces & lines. 
        - HTML only knows the tags & entities
        - i.e., why we need to specify those extra required spaces & lines in terms of tags & entities only.

    ## Types of HTML Tags

        - Container tags:
                → An element which has both opening & closing tag AND can have some content within it
                - Hence called Container tags
        - Empty tags: 
                → An element which has NO closing tag, so it cannot have content within it 
                - Hence called as Empty tags.

    <!-- Some more tags -->
    <br>       <!-- <br /> -> used to give line breaks in a webpage -->
    <hr />      <!-- <hr /> -> used to "prints horizantal rule/ divider" in a webpage -->
    This "b" tag <b>Bolds</b> the text       <!-- <b> -> used to bold format the text in a webpage -->
    This "i" tag <i>Italicise</i> the text       <!-- <b> -> used to Italicise format the text in a webpage -->
    This "u" tag <u>Underline</u> the text       <!-- <b> -> used to Underline format the text in a webpage -->

    <!-- Q2: What happens when we close an “empty tag”..? -->
    <!-- 
        NOTE:
        ----
        - we can define empty tags in 2 ways
                1. <br>
                2. <br />
        
        closing an empty tag means => <br> </br>

        Ans:
        ----
        - WKT, Empty tags can only be defined as `<br>` (or) `<br />`
        - So, if we write => <br> </br>
        - it will only consider 1st tag & omit 2nd tag => only get executed once for sure
        - But in some cases, it is executed twice
                - <br> </br> -> executed TWICE
                - <hr> </hr> -> exuted ONCE
    -->
    <hr> <br> </br> <hr />

    ## Points to remember

        1. Even if we don’t write html, body & head tags and directly write h1 or p tag with some content, 
            it will display the data on browser. Since browser itself creates those tags internally.
        2. If we write diff paragraphs or give more than 1 or 2 spaces inside p tag, 
            it won’t consider those & always displays as a single paragraph by ignoring all those extra spaces & lines.
                1. We need to use diff p tags to display diff paragraphs or use a special tag called `<br>`
        3. Google searches the google queries based on the `<title>` tag inside the `<head>` tag. 
            i.e., why title tag is V.Imp for SEO purpose
