<!-- 
    ## Atribute Types

        - Mostly, attributes will exist in pairs like → attribute = “ value “
            - here, value can be in double quotes ( “ “ ) or single quotes ( ‘ ‘ ).
        - Some attributes will exist as single & won’t have value → boolean attributes

    LIST in HTML:
    ------------

        HTML Lists are used to specify list of items.

        There are 3 types of Lists in HTML, they are:

        - Ordered List
        - Unordered List
        - Description List

    <!-- 
    Ordered List `<ol>`:
    -------------------

        - The `<ol>` tag represents an ordered list of items.
        - But to actually display the list of items, we need to use `<li>` tag → list item
        - Content enclosed within `<li>` tag only are displayed as list.


    There are several attributes that can be used within this `<ol>` tags

        - type → describes the list numbering type. [1, a, A, i, I. There is no "none"]
        - reversed → describes the list numbering in reverse manner
        - start → used to predefine the start No. of list numbering. 
        
    
    NOTE:
        - start attribute should always be in 1,2... [ NOT roman or alphabetical ]
        - if we give both start & reversed attributes together, then the numbering will start from given start value & then decrease.
        - This is the same case with type = "A" (or) "I", after "0" they will display in -ve numbers
    -->
    <ol reversed type="A" start="2">
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>python</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>CPP</li>
    </ol>


    <!-- 
        ## UnOrdered List `<ul>` :

            - The `<ul>` element represents an unordered list of items.
            - It has only 1 attribute -> "type"
            - type -> describes the list numbering type. [square, circle, disc & none]
    -->
    <ul type="square">
        <li>Eat</li>
        <li>Sleep</li>
        <li>Code</li>
        <li>Repeat</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- 
        NOTE:
        ----
            - <li> tags can be directly used to display the list of items
            - But by default, <li> displays content in un-ordered list
            - These behave as an individual elements, hence we cannot change the type of list items all together even with <div> tag
            - As these are NOT contained within <ul>, these will have the same indentation as rest of the elements 
            - If these <li> tags are enclosed within <ul>, then these will have a tab of indentation as well
    -->


    <!-- 
        Description List:
        ----------------

        - The `<dl>` element represents a description list.
            - Instead of `<li>`, it has 2 elements called `<dt>` & `<dd>`
            - The `<dt>` → "description term" element specifies a term in the list.
            - The `<dd>` → "description detail" element provides the description/definition/value for the preceding term (`<dt>`)
            - There is NO specific rule that `<dd>` should always come after `<dt>` , These can come in any of the combination
                - `<dt>` always have same indentation as the before element [just like Normal elements but NOT like <ol> & <ul>]
                - `<dd>` always will have a tab of indentation from `<dt>`
    -->
    <dl>
        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>It describes the structure of webpage</dd>

        <dt>JavaScript</dt>
        <dt>TypeScript</dt>
        <dd>Both describes the functionality of a webpage & makes them dynamic</dd>
        <dd>But Typescript is more of a strict language than Javascript</dd>

        <dt>CSS</dt>
    </dl>


    <!-- 
        Anchor Element `<a>`:
        --------------------

            - "<a>" tag is used to add links in our webpage
            - "<a>" tag converts a normal text into “hypertext”
            - 'href' → hypertext reference is must attribute for "<a>" tag
                - This will have the destination/linked page URL
                - We can give 'href' values using 2 ways
                    - `Absolute` Add → giving full add of website
                    - `Relative` Add → giving add relative to absolute
            - “target” → it describes where to open the destination/linked page. [_blank, _self, _parent & _top]
            - “download” → used to download the file
            - To create links that open in the user's email application so as to let them send a new mail
                - < a href = “ mailto: kumar.jallipalli@gmail.com “ > Mail to Kumar </a>
            - To link Telephone numbers,
                - < a href = “ tel: +9988774455 “ > Call to Kumar </a>

        - Strong Text link → The content inside a link should indicate where the link goes [ even out of context ].
        - Weak Text link → It doesn’t indicate where the link goes & just says “click here” or “here”.

        Image ELement `<img/>`:
        ----------------------

        - <img/> element is used to embed images in web pages

        - The ”src” attribute is required, and contains the URL which points out to the image to be embeded.
            - We can give the value for “src”
                    - Locally → by downloading the img & giving it’s path in the “src”
                    - Online → the whole image’s absolute address from internet as the URL

        - The ”alt” attribute holds the textual replacement for the image, which **incredibly useful** for accessibility
            - screen readers read the attribute value out loud to their users so they know what the image means.
            - 'Alt text' is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for some reason
                    - for example, network errors, content blocking, or linkrot.
            - Setting this attribute to an empty string (`alt=""`) 
                    -indicates that this image is *not* a key part of the content
                    - And broken img symbol is not displayed as well

        - “loading” → Indicates how the browser should load the image
            - eager → Loads the image immediately, even if the image is currently NOT within the visible viewport (default value).
            - lazy → Defers loading the image until it reaches a calculated distance from the viewport, as defined by the browser.
                - The intent is to avoid the network and storage bandwidth needed to handle the image until it's reasonably certain that it will be needed.
                - This generally improves the performance of the content in most typical use cases.
