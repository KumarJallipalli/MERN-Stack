# 02. Files & Folder Structure

---

## Code Flow in  `Vite`

- `Vite` only Loads the `index.html` file [ Since it is an SPA ]
    - This `index.html` file will further load the  `main.jsx` file
    - `main.jsx` file will
        1. select the `div` element from `index.html` page & 
        2. Renders the `app.jsx` code into the `div` element
    - Finally `app.jsx` code is rendered & displayed as Output

## Modify the `Vite` Code

- Remove the CSS files â†’ No Issue
- Remove assets inside `src` folder â†’ No Issue
- Remove `vite.svg` inside public folder â†’ No Issue
- So, if removed all unnecessary files [ Except config files ]â†’ No Issue
- Now, Modify the `App.jsx` component to desired code [ But it must return & export ]

```
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Vite + React</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script type="module" src="/src/main.jsx"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

```jsx
import { StrictMode } from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'

import Main from './App.jsx'

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <Main />
  </StrictMode>,
)
```

```jsx
function app () {
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Modified app component</h1>
            <h2>Welcome to React</h2>
        </div>
    )
}

export default app;
```

With only these 3 files & some config files, Code is Running Perfectly fine

## Files & Folder Structure

**`package.json`**

- `package.json` â†’ is a configuration file which contains metadata about a Node.js project.
- It used to
    - Manage project dependencies
    - Define project metadata (name, version, etc.)
    - Set up scripts to automate tasks
    - Control versions and compatibility
- Properties [ As it is a JSON file ]
    - `main` â†’ Entry point of your app. [ Default is `index.js` ]
    - `scripts` â†’ Defines custom command-line scripts.
    - `dependencies` â†’ Essential Packages required to run the app [ in Production/runtime ]
    - `devDependencies` â†’ Packages/tools required only to develop, test or build the app

**`package-lock.json`** 

- `package-lock.json`  â†’ is an **automatically generated file** by `npm` that **locks the exact versions** of every installed package & itâ€™s nested dependencies.
- It ensures **consistent installs** across environments. [ i.e., everyone installs the exact same versions ]
- It is pushed to GitHub

**`public`**

- The `public` folder contains **static files** that are served directly to the browser.
- These files are NOT Processed by Built Tools [ Copied as it is ]

**`src`**

- The `src` folder contains all your **application Source Code**
- These files are Processed by Built Tools

**`node_modules`**

- `node_modules` is the **directory** which contains **all the installed dependencies** [ & their nested dependencies ] listed in `package.json`
- These dependencies/packages are installed & managed by `npm`
- `node_modules` folder gets created when you run `npm install`
    - When you run `npm install`, Node.js:
        - Reads `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
        - Resolves dependencies.
        - Installs them inside the `node_modules` folder.
- `node_modules` is NOT pushed to GitHub
    - As it is Very Large
    - It can be get back by running `npm install`
        - As all these dependencies/packages are installed & managed by `npm` using `package.json`

## Components

- `Component` â†’ A **reusable piece of code** that defines **how a part of the user interface (UI) should look and behave**.
- **Component is the building block** of a React application [ Used to build UI ]

ðŸš€ Why Components Matter

- **Reusability** â€“ Write once, use multiple times
- **Modularity** â€“ Break complex UI into manageable parts
- **Maintainability** â€“ makes debugging [ & Updating ] easier
- **Declarative Logic** â€“ Define **how** the UI should look like && React updates it efficiently.
- **Readability**: Clear structure and separation of concerns

Rules:

1. **Component Names Must Start with Capital Letters**
    - JSX treats lowercase tags as HTML elements.
2. Components Must Return a Single JSX Element
    - Wrap multiple elements in a single parent, like a `<div>`, or use fragments (`<>...</>`)
3. Components Should Be Pure Functions
    - **`pure function`**: given the same input (props), it should always return the same output.
4. Avoid Direct DOM Manipulation
    1. Let React handle the DOM, React updates DOM efficiently
5. Use Hooks Only in Function Components (and only at the top level)
6. Props and state are immutable
    1. Props are read-only [ Immutable ]. If you need to update data, use state.

## Library ( vs ) Framework

- `Library` â†’ A **library** is a collection of pre-written code (functions, classes, etc.) used to perform specific tasks.
    - You control the flow of your application â€” you call the library when you need it
- `Framework` â†’ A **framework** is a **platform** [ with predefined structure ] for building applications.
    - predefined structure  â†’ It defines **how your code should be written and organized**.
    - **framework** control the flow of your application â€” it **calls your code** when needed  [ This is known as **Inversion of Control ]**
