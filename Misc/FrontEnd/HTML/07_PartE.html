<!-- 
    <FORM> tag:
    --------
    `<form>` tag is used to Collect the data from User.
        - `action` attribute is used to describe where to send the collected data (or)
            - It describes which actions to be performed on the submitted data
        - ex: <form action=”/action.php”> → this sends the collected data to action.php file
--> 

<!-- 
    <input> tag:
    -----------
    `<input/>` tag → used to collect diff/multiple types of data from user

    - It uses `type` atribute to take diff diff types of data from user.
    - ex: `<input type = 'text' />`

        `type = 'text'` → creates an input box which can take text data from user 

        `type = 'password'` → creates an input box which hides the input data from user for sensitivity

        `type = 'number'` → creates an input box which takes only numbers as data from user

        `type = 'time'` → creates an input box which takes time from user [like 10: 20 PM]

        `type = 'color'` → creates an input box which takes color from user [RGB value]
-->

<!-- 
    <button>:
    --------
    `<button>` element is used to submit the form’s data
        - It will submit the data to the value mentioned in the `action` attribute.
        - It’s behavior changes depeneding on where the button is positioned
    
    NOTE:
    ----
    - No matter what, if a button element is inside a form element, it will submit the collected data . [default behavior]
    - If the button is outside the form element, then it will behave just like a button [type=”button”] even if we explicitly change the type too
-->

<!-- 
    "name" attribute:
    ----------------
    Whatever the data we have collected & submitted, it will be used in the backend/DB.
    → So to access these collected data in the backend/DB, we need to have some reference to each of the collected data
    → i.e., where “name” attribute will be used. 
    → name is used to refer/access the data entered in the <input/> element from backend

    All of the form’s data is submitted in the form of “name=value” pair
        → value will be that input data entered by user
        → name will be the value of the name attribute corresponding to that <input/> element 

    These “name=value” pair is sent/submitted to the action’s attribute value [file/url]
    ex: if action=”/server” & name=”user”, input value by the user is “Jerry”
    → then upon submitting, the url will appear like “server?user=jerry”
-->


<!-- 
    Radio Buttons:
    -------------
    - It is an `<input/>` element where attribute type=”radio”
    - It is very simillar to “checkbox” but able to select only 1 option out of many.
        - This will happen/work, only when the options are grouped
        - Grouping means, all the `<input/>` element must have same `“name”` attribute value
            - "Grouping" → user will be able to select only 1 option out of many
            - Even if he tries to select multiple opt, other's will be de-selected
    - Used in true/false, gender selection, subjects selection so on…
-->

<!-- 
    checkbox:
    --------
    - It is an `<input/>` element where attribute type=”checkbox”
    - `checked` → attribute makes the checkbox ON by default
    - Mainly used in Terms & condition
    - Adv → We can select multiple checkboxes & all of them will be ON
    - "Grouping" won't work in case of checkboxes

    NOTE:
    ----
💡 If the checkbox is
        - checked → ON & it will be sent in URL with “name=on” format
        - unchecked → OFF && nothing will be sent in URL when submitted

    This is due to that user don’t enter any data, he just selects the box. 
    i.e. why, depending on the user selection only, either ON or nothing is sent in the `action`
-->

<!-- 
    IMP points regarding "checkboxes" & "Radio buttons"
    --------------------------------------------------
    In checkboxes & Radiobuttons, there is 1 very imp attribute called "value" 
        → As these are selection based data inputs, only ON or nothing is passed into action 
        → we will have multiple options to select but only 1 got selected & sent as ON. 
        → Hence it is difficult in backend side to understand which one got selected by user
        → This is where the "value" attribute comes into picture
        → So, Instead of sending ON value, It sends the “value” of the value attribute into action 
        → In this way, we can know which value got selected from backend side itself

        Hence when it comes to both checkboxes & radio buttons, 2 are imp things
        1. name attribute → for grouping
        2. value attribute → to override the value in the “name="###” pair
-->

<!-- 
    Dropdown:
    --------
    - `<select>` element is used to create “dropdown’s” in HTML, instead of `<~~input~~>`
    - Silimar to <table> & <form> elements, `<select>` elements creates a dropdow with no data/value
    - So, we use another element `<option>` to give the dropdown values
    - `selected` → attribute makes any option selected by default [pre-selection]
    - Used in, selecting a state or country

    NOTE:
    ----
    In dropdowns,
    → “value” attribute is not a mandatory one, as the dropdown option itself will be taken as the value

    → Remember, dropdown’s are NOT under <input> elements, It is under <select> element
    → If you want to give “placeholder” in your dropdown box, 
        - we will give using the <option> element only, with the content inside it acting as a placeholder
-->

<!-- 
    Range:
    -----
    It is an `<input/>` element where attribute type=”range”
    - used to give larger selection values, instead of checkboxes & radio buttons
        - `min` → attribute used to give the LOWER limit
        - `max` → attribute used to give the UPPER limit
        - `value` → attribute used to give the preset value [This is NOT a mandatory field]
            - If it clashes with step value, then it will take the nearest upper step value Only if “min” is not defined
        - `step` → attribute used to give the step incremental/decremental
    - Used in, volume controls (or) brightness controls
-->

<!-- 
    text-area:
    ---------
    - Instead of `<~~input~~/>` element, we have `<textarea>` element to take large amount of text data
    - This is a container tag, so whatever the content you write within it, it will appear in the textarea box.
        - If you give any placeholder with some content in the textarea, it will display content by overiding the placeholder’s value
    - `rows` & `cols` are used to define the area of the textarea
    - default will be → cols="10" rows="2”
    - Ex: Feedback forms

    NOTE:
    ----
    → In the text input element’s if you give the value of placeholder very large also, it will only display upto it’s defined width
    → If you give any placeholder value with some content in the input element, it will display content by overiding the placeholder’s value
    → If you use more than 1 "for" attribute in a label & give diff id’s in it, still it will only have connection with the 1st id.
-->

<!-- 
    <fieldset>:
    ----------
    - The `<fieldset>` tag is used to group related elements in a form & draws a box around them
    - `<legend>` → describes the caption/title to the grouped filedset elements

    <!-- 
        <label> tag:
        -----------
        - `<label>` element represents a caption/label to a specific item in the UI
        - It is used to create a link/connection between a caption & an Input box 

        - There are 2 ways of creating link between caption & Input box
    -->
            <!-- 1st way -->
            Username:
            <input type="text" placeholder="Username">
            
            <!-- 2nd way -->
            <label>
                Username:
                <input type="text" placeholder="Username">
            </label>
    <!-- 
        The difference between the above 2 ways are:
        - In the 1st way, there is NO connection made between the text “Username” & “Input” box, 
            - Hence Those two are independent from each other.
        - In the 2nd way, Username became a caption to the Input box & highlights the input box
            - This connection is made by `<label>` tag
    -->

            <!-- Classical Approach -->
            <label for="username"> Username: </label>
            <input type="text" id="username">
    <!-- 
        - here too both the “Username” from <label> element & <input/> elements are connected
            - But now, the connection is made through the `“for”` & `“id”` attributes of `<label>` & `<input/>` elements respectively
        - The values of these attributes must be same in order happen a connection between them.

<!-- 
    SUMMARY:
    -------
    - <form> element -> to collect data from users
    - action attribute -> describes where to send the collected data

    - <input> -> element that actually collects different types of data inside form 
    - <label> -> to link the input box & caption
    - type="radio" -> "name" attribute is V.Imp as it groups radio buttons together
    - "value" attribute is V.Imp for both "radio" & "checkboxes" as it is sent in the URL when submitted

    - <select> -> to collect dropdown data
    - <option> -> to actually define the dropdown data
    - Here, "value" attribute's value is sent if defined, else dropdown content is taken as value

    - <textarea> -> used to collect large data
    - content within this tag replaces placeholder's value
