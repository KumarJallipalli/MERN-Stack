    What is an IP address..?
        - A unique identifying number assigned to every device connected to the internet
                - It's like an ID-number given to the devices when connected to internet
                - If we assume internet services to be postal services, then mails/letters to be data
                - Then to/from address will be IP address

        - It is a protocol for addressing & routing the packets of data to their correct destination

        - An IPv4 address consists of four numbers [0 - 225], with a single dot (.) separating each number
        - With these combination of numbers, we still ran out of IP address in 2015
        - Hence An IPv6 address introduced which consists of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits.

        - But remembering these numbers for humans is not possible, Hence domain names were used
        - DNS -> maps the domains names with the corresponding IP addresses
        - Hence, we area able to search/request/send data using domain names instead of IP addresses
